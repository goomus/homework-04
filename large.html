	<p>One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled 
dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed into 
a horrible vermin. He lay on his armour-like back, 
and if he lifted his head a little he could see his 
brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into 
stiff sections. The bedding was hardly able to cover 
<strong>strong</strong> it and seemed ready to slide 
off any moment. His many legs, pitifully thin 
compared with the size of the rest of him, 
<a class="external ext" href="#">link</a> waved about 
helplessly as he looked. "What's happened to me? " he 
thought. It wasn't a dream. His room, a proper human 
room although a little too small, lay peacefully 
between its four familiar walls.</p>

Gregor then turned to look out the window at the dull 
weather. Drops of rain could be heard hitting the pane, 
which made him feel quite sad. "How about if I sleep a 
little bit longer and forget all this nonsense", he 
thought, but that was something he was unable to do 
because he was used to sleeping on his right, and in 
his present state couldn't get into that position. 
However hard he threw himself onto his right, he 
always rolled back to where he was.
